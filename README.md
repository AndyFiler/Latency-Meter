# Latency-Meter
This program lets you measure latency of your system given that you have arduino.

It requires arduino running code from \Arduino\SystemLatencyMeter\SystemLatencyMeter.ino


So... This is my First c++ code, pls be gentle. There is so much garbage and useless code that is perhaps slowing evrything down that It's unbelivable but that's why I put it on Git, to solve those issues with the help of this amazing community!
